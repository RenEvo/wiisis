**Wiisis API**

The Wiisis API is a collection of code that interfaces with the Nintendo Wii Remote and brings it in to the CryENGINE 2 Public SDK. Its architecture is designed to fit smoothly in with the CE2 SDK environment, making it very easy for teams to migrate it into their own mods. Bring the Nintendo Wii Remote into your own Crysis modification!

Uploaded the API documentation into the Wiki pages.

**Update 12/05/07**

I have created this Google Code page to house the SVN repository for the API. The plan is to have the API prepared for release along side the actual mod, after the public SDK is made available.
