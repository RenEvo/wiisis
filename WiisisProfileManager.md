# Description #

The Remote Profile in Wiisis defines user settings for the Wii Remote Manager to go by, including sensitivity levels for gestures and button mapping. It reads and writes the values to/from an XML file for loading and saving, respectively.

It also defines several console commands that can be used to alter the values from in-game.
