= About the API =

The Wiisis API is a collection of code that allows you to interface with a Nintendo Wii Remote from within the Game DLL source in the CryENGINE 2 Public SDK.

The API is divided up into two parts:
  * The actual Wii Remote (WR) Library for interfacing with the remote.
  * Source code for the Wiisis modification which makes use of the WR Library.
