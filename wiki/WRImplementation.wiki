= Description =

The Implementation files include all of the interface header files used by the library. Several macros are also safely defined to ensure the library compiles and executes successfully.

The *CWR_GlobalInstance* class is a singleton class. It can be accessed in three ways:
{{{
CWR_GlobalInstance *pWR = CWR_GlobalInstance::GetInstance();
CWR_GlobalInstance *pWR = GetWiiRemoteSystem(); // Global function
CWR_GlobalInstance *pWR = g_pWR; // Externalized reference
}}}

It also houses an error listener which will notify you if an error occurs in any of the sub-modules.
